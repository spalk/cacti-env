_Succulents and cacti indoor environment monitoring_

The main idea of project is to monitor environment around plants indoors and improve condtions where they live.

### First step: data collecting

The monitored parameters are:
- temperature
- light level
- relative humidity
- soil moisture

There are also other additional parameters taken into account:
- atmospheric pressure
- outside temperature
- position of sun 
- position of moon
   
All of this parameters a recorded every minute. 


### Second step: data analysing

For each parameters are defined theoretical ranges, when plants feel happy. This ranges can be ajusted according to visual conditions of plants or new theoretical information.

### Third step: action

In cases when some parameter is out of range actions taken to return it to normal value.
